For many use cases, this  restriction is not important - except in very specific instances, pure  computational activities will run faster using all threads.  But in some cases,  we may want to keep the primary thread free of blocking tasks.  For example, a  GUI running on the primary thread will become unresponsive if a computational  task hits.  As another example, parallel computations with very nonuniform  processing times can benefit from sacrificing the primary thread to manage the  loads on the remaining ones.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"ThreadPools.jl Documentation","title":"ThreadPools.jl Documentation","text":"ThreadPools is a simple package that allows background-only Task assignment for  cases where this makes sense.  The standard foreach,  map, and @threads  functions are mimicked, adding a bg prefix to each to denote background  operation: bgforeach, bgmap, and @bgthreads.   Code that runs with one of  those Base functions should run just fine with the  bg prepended, but adding multithreading for free in the foreach and map  cases, and in all cases keeping the primary thread free of blocking Tasks.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"ThreadPools.jl Documentation","title":"ThreadPools.jl Documentation","text":"When the user would still like to include the primary thread, fg versions of the above functions are provided: fgforeach, fgmap,  and @fgthreads.
